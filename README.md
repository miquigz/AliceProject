# Alice Project
``Is a Graphic Aventure, firstly designed in processing (Enviorement design Java), that later on, converted to javascript language.
The story is 100% fictitious, it should not be taken seriously.
``
## Run project:
``
Download zip or clone project, and then; open the index.html
``  
## Used and its why:
* The adventure was first made in 100% vanilla javascript, and 100% vanilla css, in the purpose of learning.
* To put into practice my knowledge of ajax requests, I made one; making a request to a json file inside the same folder where the project is.
* I decided to use webpack, to optimize my adventure graphic, but it is made 100% in vanilla js.

#### The adventure game is currently only available in Spanish.
